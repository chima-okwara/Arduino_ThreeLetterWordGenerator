## **Arduino Three Letter Word Generator**

#### **Main Version.**


An arduino project to generate random three-letter words and display them on an LCD screen.
***
**Program Flow**


* The program begins by printing a welcome message to the LCD screen.

* The objects for the Yes and No buttons are initialised.

* The word generator object is also initialised.

* Each time a word is generated, the program asks if the word is correct.

* The user presses the 'yes' button if the word is correct, and presses the 'no' button if the word is incorrect.
***
### **TLDR; Part :D**

* The words are generated by using random numbers generated by seeding the current time into the ```random()``` function.

## **Directory Structure**

./Arduino_ThreeLetterWordGenerator
* /lib/                 
 This directory contains the xlwg library, adapted to work with Arduino

* /src/main.cpp               
This contains the main source file with the setup() and loop() Arduino functions.





Important points to note:
* This code is written for PlatformIO IDE.
* To use it in ArduinoIDE, some adjustments may have to be made to the code, suint8_t as changing the file directory structure.
* This code has been tested and verified to work on an Arduino Mega2560.
