#****************************     Arduino_ThreeLetterWordGenerator     ****************************#

An arduino project to generate random three-letter words and display them on a 1602 LCD screen.

****************************************************************************************************
#Program flow:

**
*When the program is run, the time of day is stored in a variable 'sec' as a long integer that signifies the number of seconds since 1/1/1970 00:00.

*Using the variable 'sec', the function randomSeed() is called, which the seed for the random number generator.

*The function random() is then made to generate a random number between 0 and 25.

*Note also that the array alphabets[] consists of 26 elements (i.e. letters of the English language alphabets). These elements are labelled 0 to 25.

*The random number generated is used to select a corresponding alphabet from the array 'alphabets[]' three times, for the three letters of the word.

*The final word is a concatenation of the three letters generated, called 'Word'.
**

#_TLDR:_#

**The words are generated by using random numbers generated by seeding the current time into the random() function.

Important points to note:
*This code is written for PlatformIO IDE.
*To use it in ArduinoIDE, some adjustments may have to be made to the code, such as changing the file directory structure.
